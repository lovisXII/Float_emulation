# Float_emulation

The purpose of the program is to emulate the operation of floats. It has been created for systems that doesnt have FPU and can't use float operation.

I tried to make it as low lvl as possible to avoid the use of any library.

# How to use

Just import "float_emu.h" in your code and use the function ``mult_float``
